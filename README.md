# Portfolio-App
This app contains my details for example my name and the career I do .It's accompanied by my experience in various programming languages e/g HTML,Kotlin,Java e.t.c
There is a button called Change theme where one can change the theme of the app from light mode to dark mode.
There is also Imageviews like LinkedIN,Instagram and Github when you click themit takes you to my social media.
I used the Sharepreference mode
When I have more time I'd like to add a button where one can download my CV automatically and a spinner where one can choose his/her languages from.
